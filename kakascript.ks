kaka is True.
(kaka is True #say lakaka)

this code basically declares a variable named baba in the first line
in the second line it checks if kaka is True and if it is True it says 'lakaka'
btw you can now write comments like these. you dont need anything. just dont include an 'is' and dont and the line with a dot
